This means that you can call a static method without creating an object of the class.    void means that the method has no return value. If the method returned an int you would write int instead of void.    The combination of all three of these is most commonly seen on the main method which most tutorials will include.  ,3,1,892CA6a-8c802:759GA-8a-5a-285,4,Professional_Developer,6,31,Female,University;Web,INDIA,PHP;MySQL

On line 85; translate is being passed 3 arguments when it only takes 2 parameters. I'm not sure how this is possible. Its return value is also being assigned to the int ""consumed"" yet it is a void function. Furthermore; the function seems to be recursively calling itself in a way that would not advance progression (still with incorrect arguments).    On first call of translate; for example; it would; itself; call translate with  (input; 0; out) which are invalid arguments and would just lead to translate calling itself again with the same arguments. I can see in the loop where pos WOULD increment but it recursively calls Translate first.    I am assuming I am just missing some of the ins and outs of Java; so anyway;  the only thing I can guess might be wrong with out is that translate it passing it as a third parameter to itself with no apparent override that actually takes 3 parameters.",1,1,998eE-6g-2A350:631gg-5g6c-980,4,Hobbyist,3,28,Male,Web,US,C#

The source code provided doesn't quite match the code that is being tested; at least since we only get to look at the version of add() method with one parameter; while in the tested code we have s.add taking two arguments. So it's hard to predict what that 3.0 stands for. However; the obvious typo that is present in the source code provided; that might very well be the cause of the failure; is in lines 299 and 301. In this segment of the code we're dealing with maxMiddleIndex and should really be getting values for our calculations from this.maxMiddleIndex; not this.minMiddleIndex. Because of this typo what we're actually doing is checking whether the middle value of our currently processed time period is greater than the middle value of the time period with the lowest middle value; which is incoherent with our logic and is sure to cause invalid results.,10,4,845EI-3g-3E700,5,Undergraduate_Student,6,21,Male,High School,United States,C#; C++

The one you show takes a TimePeriodValue. (wrong number of arguments). Assuming that SimpleTimePeriod is a subclass of TimePeriodValue; the first arg would be an ok type.  According to the web; these classes are from org.jfree.data.time on jfreechart.  The top line of SimpleTimePeriod is public class SimpleTimePeriod implements TimePeriod; Comparable; Serializable. The top line of TimePeriodValue is public class TimePeriodValue implements Cloneable; Serializable so STP is not a subclass of TPV and you are showing us the wrong add method.     The period of the TPV is sent to updatebounds and you likely needed to show us the TPV constructor so we knew which input the period was (0L or 50L).   public TimePeriodValue(TimePeriod period; Number value) {          if (period == null) {              throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Null 'period' argument."");          }          this.period = period;          this.value = value;      }  What we actually have is two longs from STP  public SimpleTimePeriod(long start; long end) {          if (start > end) {              throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Requires start <= end."");          }          this.start = start;          this.end = end;      }  btw; here is the documentation link on the web. Since you are studying tool usage.. thats the tool i'm using. http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/api/javadoc/index.html    Your add method seems to want to pass a whole time period (the whole STP) and the number of items-1 (aka 0) in the set of time periods... ok.. calling updatebounds on the whole STP and 0.    we'll also need getMaxMiddleIndex() which is not shown here.  The documentation says ""Returns the index of the time period with the maximum middle milliseconds."" there is only one time period in this set so its gotta be the index of this time period.    Unfortunatly I'm not finding code for TimePeriodValues; just TimePeriodValue and SimpleTimePeriod so I'm unsure what the min and max start indexes are. Really; if one of my students gave me this and asked for help; I'd make them show me the relevant code and have them handtrace thru it.

However; I don't see an add method in TimePeriodValues that take a SimpleTimePeriod and a double.  I'm lead to belief there's some else in the code I can't see that's calling a method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double).  Because the output indicates the code compiles and doesn't receive a runtime exception.    Assuming the method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double) is calling updateBounds(TimePeriod; int); this seems a little off because updateBounds takes an int.    There seems to be a few type mismatch issues in the code above and below.

I think using a different name would make the code more readable; and enable someone maintaining the code to have a better shot at understanding it and fixing it. Perhaps you have to define array to be of type Object instead of assuming it's actually an array of some type like String if you're going to let folks call it with a null array.  Then the cast won't fail; and you can go through further steps to find out IF its class is Array; an then if so you can get the class of the first array object to figure out it's a String.  Lot of indirection here ... but maybe that's what you have to do if you're going to allow it.,1,1,67AI-8G5A71-3:163Aa0i0a963:161eg5c5I-649,5,Other,30,61,Male,High School;University;Other Leanred more experts at work,US,none at present; most C and ksh in past; C++;

After the explicit conversion to a long and then the implicit conversion back to a double for the comparison I think you may end up with the test 0.0 == -0.0 we I imagine would evaluate to false. If this is the case then line 263 gets executed and I suspect String.valueOf(x) is converting -0.0 to 0.    If the code block on line 247 is entered then I suspect the issue is line 248. I believe longs only have one representation for zero so the cast converts -0.0 to 0.
