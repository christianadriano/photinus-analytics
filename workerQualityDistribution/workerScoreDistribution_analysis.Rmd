### The goal of the study
  <p>Distribution of worker skill level across questions has the potential to bias the outcomes of the larger crowdsourcing task. The reason is that software faults can be overlooked if they are covered by questions* that were mostly answered by lower skill workers. </p>

<p>*Each question covers a certain number of source code lines. Questions have the following format:"Do you believe the source code between lines 35 and 45 is related to the described failure?"</p>
  
<p>  Therefore, my goal is to investigate how worker skill level is distributed across questions. Worker skill level was measured by the following three attributes. 
  <du>
  <li>Test score: workers received a score (zero to five) after performing a computer programming test used to filter
   out workers without enough programming knowledge. Workers who scored 2 or less were not allowed to participate.
  <li>Years of programming experience: Worker quality can also be measured by years of programming experience, which is an information self-declared by workers befote they take any test. 
   <li>Profession: worker profession is also an indicator of quality. Professions consisted of professional programmers, hobbyists, graduate students, undergraduate students, and others.
   </du>

###Focus of the current analysis
<p>The current analysis focuses only on the <b>worker test score</b>.</p>

##function to count the numer of scores at level x for each question
countScoreLevel<- function(level){
  subset_df <-subset(dataf,select= c(Worker.score));
  subset_df <- data.frame(subset_df); 
  
  scoreCount<- rowSums(subset_df==level); 
  subset_df["scoreCount"] <- scoreCount;
  subset_df["Question.ID"] <- dataf$Question.ID;

  subset_df <-subset(subset_df,select= c(Question.ID,scoreCount));
  question_by <- group_by(subset_df,Question.ID);
  summaryTable <- summarize(question_by,sum(scoreCount));
  colnames(summaryTable)<-c("QuestoinID","scoreCount");
 
  return(summaryTable);
}

level<-3;
tableScore_3 <- countScoreLevel(level);
title<- paste("Fig.1 - Distribution of worker with score level",level,"across questions");
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(tableScore_3,aes(x=scoreCount))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) +
  ggtitle(title) +
  labs(y="question count", x="worker score per question")
```
<br>Fig.1 shows that 20 questions had each 6 workers with score level-3, while 25 had each 5 workers with score level-3 The shape of the histograms resemble a normal distribuions
Nonetheless, the data actually does not pass the Shapiro-Wilk normality test
shapiro.test(tableScore_3$scoreCount);

This is also the case for the score levels 4 and 5 as shown in the charts below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
level<- 4;
tableScore_4 <- countScoreLevel(level);
title<- paste("Fig.2 - Distribution of worker with score level",level,"across questions");
ggplot(tableScore_4,aes(x=scoreCount))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) +
  ggtitle(title) +
  labs(y="question count", x="worker score per question")
 
shapiro.test(tableScore_4$scoreCount);

level<- 5;
tableScore_5 <- countScoreLevel(level);
title<- paste("Fig.3 - Distribution of worker with score level",level,"across questions");
ggplot(tableScore_5,aes(x=scoreCount))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) +
  ggtitle(title) +
  labs(y="question count", x="worker score per question");
shapiro.test(tableScore_5$scoreCount);
```

<br>The distribution shapes are distinct, but we performed a non-parametric test to verify if
the averages are also distinct.Since we are doing multiple comparisons, I applied 
the Bonferroni adjustment. Since I will make 3 comparisons, the corrected confidence level 
of is  1 - 0.05/3 =  0.0167 =0.983
```{r, echo=FALSE}
wilcox.test(tableScore_3$scoreCount,tableScore_4$scoreCount,alternative = c("two.sided"), conf.level = 0.983);
wilcox.test(tableScore_3$scoreCount,tableScore_5$scoreCount,alternative = c("two.sided"), conf.level = 0.983);
wilcox.test(tableScore_5$scoreCount,tableScore_4$scoreCount,alternative = c("two.sided"), conf.level = 0.983);
```
<br>In all test, the null-hypothesis was rejected, which implies that the three data sets have different averages 
considering a confidence interval of 98.3%.

The previous analysis show that workers are not equally distributed in
terms of test score. This might be an issue because questions that 
were answered by workers with lower score, might have been overlooked.

However, on average, worker score might still be more equally distributed
across questions. This is what I will investigate next.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Data formatting
#1.concatenate the columns with count of levels per question
#2.compute the average score for each questions. I do that with a vector product of
#number of scores at level 3 x 3 + at level 4 X 4, at level 5 x 5
#after that I divide by 3 to take the average.
tableScores<-matrix(nrow = 129, ncol = 4);
tableScores[,1]<-tableScore_3$QuestoinID;
tableScores[,2]<-tableScore_3$scoreCount;
tableScores[,3]<-tableScore_4$scoreCount;
tableScores[,4]<-tableScore_5$scoreCount;
colnames(tableScores)<-c("QuestionID","level_3","level_4","level_5");

scores<-c(3,4,5);
countVec<-c(1,1,1);

productScores<-(tableScores[,2:4]%*%scores); #vector product
countItemsVec<-(tableScores[,2:4]%*%countVec); #count number of scores per question
averageScores<- productScores / countItemsVec; #obtain the average score for each question

summary(averageScores)
boxplot(averageScores, main="average worker score per question", ylab="average worker score")

```
<br>We can see that the interval of average scores is reasonably tight, from 3.8 to 4.6
We have two data points below 3.6, which I at least one outlier below 3.8
<br>

```{r, comment, echo=FALSE}

#Remove outliers
averageScores<-data.frame(averageScores);
averageScores <-averageScores[!averageScores$averageScores<3.8,];

#Plot distribution
averageScores<-data.frame(averageScores);
colnames(averageScores)<-"averageScores";

title<- paste("Fig.4 - Distribution of average worker score per question");
ggplot(averageScores,aes(x=averageScores))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02) +
  ggtitle(title) +
  labs(y="score count", x="average worker score per question")

shapiro.test(averageScores$averageScores);
```
<br> I can also quantify how concentrated the average score is around score level 4. I can do this by computing the the probability of a question having an average score above 4.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
scores<-averageScores$averageScores;
pop_sd <- sd(scores)*sqrt((length(scores)-1)/(length(scores)));
pop_mean <- mean(scores);
z <- (4 - pop_mean) / pop_sd;

cat("Probability of average score above 4=", round((1-pnorm(z))*100,2),"%");
```

###Conclusion
Although workers are not equally distributed in terms of score, the average worker score per 
question follows a normal distribution, which allows to infer that on average 90% of questions received workers with score above 4. Since the maximum score is 5, this represents a small variation across questions.
