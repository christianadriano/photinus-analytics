#Compute speed of subcrowds

#Programmers performed up to three microtasks for each software failure resolution task. 
#Therefore, microtasks performed by the same programmer, were necessarily done in a sequence. We called these sequences execution streaks.
#To obtain the time to execute all the microtasks for one failure resolution task, we just need to compute the longest streak.
#We also computed the qualification time, which is the time to for each programmer to provide consent, answer the survey, and take the qualification test.
#This way, we compute all the time that is affected by our method. Time to recruit enough workers is outside our method.
#We tried to positively influence the speed of recruitment with a set measures. We made initial posting when US population is awake (6 am PCT).
#We provided appropriate intrinsic motivation by paying the equivalent to the minimal wage in California (9 dollars/hour).
#We described the study in a way to sensibilize participants on the importance of the study (extrinsic motivation)
#However, in the second experiment, we did not announce the tasks in MTurk forums, this way we tried to mitigate bias on our measurements of
#the recruitment speed on MT. 
#Later on the paper we evaluate the outcome of these measures.

#Note that the design of experiment-1 had longer streaks because each programmer was offered ten microtasks that had to be performed in a sequence.

#Workforce concentration
#Moreover, we posted microtasks for all eight failure resolutions at the same time. Therefore, we did not optimize to have all programmers focused on one failure resolution at a time. 
#In practical situation, an agile team would prefer to have one failure resolution ready before giving a new task to the crowd. This way
#the agile team can be working on a fix while the crowd works on a new failure resolution.
