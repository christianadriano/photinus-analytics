Goal: Analyze the outcomes at different cut times for which all questions received the same number of answers.
i.e., could we have located all faults earlier? If positive, how would have been our efficacy and cost?

Analysis Questions:

How many faults were located at each cut time?
How many workers, answers, and lines to inspect?
Precision and recall for all three aggregation methods (AM.1, AM.2, and AM.3).
AM.1 = Yes - No >0
AM.2 = Yes > 5
AM.3 = Top 2 questions with most Yes answers

This analysis is part of section 5 of the TSE Journal paper.
